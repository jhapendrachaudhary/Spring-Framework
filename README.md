# Java Spring Boot Learning Repository

This repository contains my practice projects, exercises, and experiments while learning **Java Spring, Spring Boot, and related frameworks**.  
It is not a production project but a collection of hands-on code examples for understanding core concepts.

## 📂 Repository Structure

- **SpringCore** → Basics of Spring Core (IoC, DI, Beans, ApplicationContext)
- **SpringJDBC** → Working with JDBC Template and database connectivity
- **SpringMVC** → MVC architecture, Controllers, Views

- **Hibernate / JPA**
- **Thymeleaf**
- **MySQL / H2 (for DB practice)**

---

## 🎯 Purpose

- Learn and implement different **Spring concepts** step by step  
- Practice **backend development** with **Spring Boot**  
- Explore **security, ORM, REST APIs, and template engines**

## 📝 Notes

- Each folder is an independent project.  
- Run them separately in **IntelliJ IDEA** / **Eclipse** / **Spring Tool Suite**.  
- Some projects may require database setup (check `application.properties`).
