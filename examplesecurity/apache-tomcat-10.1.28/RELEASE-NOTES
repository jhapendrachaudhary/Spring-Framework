===================
Dependency Changes:
===================
Tomcat 10.1 is designed to run on Java 11 and later.


==============
API Stability:
==============

The public interfaces for the following classes are fixed and will not be
changed at all during the remaining lifetime of the 10.x series:
- All classes in the jakarta namespace

The public interfaces for the following classes may be added to in order to
resolve bugs and/or add new features. No existing interface method will be
removed or changed although it may be deprecated.
- org.apache.catalina.* (excluding sub-packages)

Note: As Tomcat 10 matures, the above list will be added to. The list is not
      considered complete at this time.

The remaining classes are considered part of the Tomcat internals and may change
without notice between point releases.
